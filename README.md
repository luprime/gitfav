## 👨🏽‍💻 Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- Git e Github
- JavaScript

## 💭 What have I learn?

On this challenge I just altered some styles from the last project, added some icons on the site, so it was not that simples as the last one.
It was a really nice expirience, so I could train some coding without help from others.
